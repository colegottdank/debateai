# Guest Mode Launch - Content Drafts

**Goal:** Drive traffic to `debateai.org` (guest mode allows debating without sign-up).
**Hook:** "AI Debate Platform: Watch Two Models Argue Or Join In (No Sign-Up)"
**CTA:** "Try it out: debateai.org"

## Reddit Drafts

### Subreddit: r/SideProject / r/InternetIsBeautiful
**Title:** I built a platform where you can watch AI models debate each other (or jump in yourself) - No sign-up required!

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I've been working on **DebateAI** for a few weeks. The idea is simple: pick a topic, choose two AI personas (e.g., "Elon Musk" vs "Socrates", or "Optimist" vs "Pessimist"), and watch them debate.

Initially, we required sign-up, but I realized that's a huge barrier for something you just want to play with for 2 minutes.

So today I shipped **Guest Mode**. You can now:
1. Go to [debateai.org](https://debateai.org)
2. Start a debate immediately (no account needed).
3. Watch the AI models argue back and forth in real-time.
4. If you want, you can jump in and argue against one of them.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Convex (Real-time DB + Backend)
- Clerk (Auth - optional now!)
- Tailwind CSS
- GPT-4 / Claude 3 (under the hood)

I'd love feedback on the debate quality. Does the AI actually make good points, or does it feel too generic?

Let me know what you think!

**Title:** Watching two AI models debate "Is AI Conscious?" is surprisingly entertaining (Guest Mode Live)

**Body:**
I set up a debate between a "Skeptical Scientist" persona and a "Spiritual Futurist" persona on my site [DebateAI](https://debateai.org).

The result was... weirdly deep. The Scientist kept demanding empirical evidence, while the Futurist argued about the nature of subjective experience.

I just opened up **Guest Mode** so you don't need an account to try it.

**Try it here:** [debateai.org](https://debateai.org)

You can create your own matchups (e.g., "Trump vs Biden" on "Crypto Regulation").

Would love to see what weird debates you can generate. Post the transcripts here if you find good ones!

### Thread 1 (Launch Announcement)
1/5 🚀 Big Update: **Guest Mode is LIVE on DebateAI!**

You can now watch AI models debate *any* topic without creating an account.

Just visit debateai.org, pick a topic, and hit "Start Debate".

No login. No friction. Just arguments. 🗣️🤖

2/5 Why Guest Mode?
We realized asking for a sign-up just to *see* what the AI does was too much friction.
Now you can experience the core value in seconds.
The AI personas (e.g., "Socrates", "Tech Bro", "Angry Boomer") have distinct personalities.

3/5 My favorite matchup so far:
"Elon Musk" vs "Karl Marx" on "Mars Colonization".
Elon: "It's the future of humanity!"
Marx: "It's just escaping the problems of capitalism!"
😂

4/5 Under the hood:
Built with @nextjs, @convex_dev, and @clerkdev.
Real-time streaming responses.
Customizable persona prompts.

5/5 Try it out now:

Let me know what crazy debates you create! #AI #BuildInPublic #SaaS #DebateAI
