## Recommendations
1. **Fix Repetition:** Detect if AI starts consecutive messages with similar phrases ("While...", "I understand...").
2. **Engagement:** Ensure every AI response ends with a provocative question to drive the debate forward.
3. **Formatting:** Use bolding for key points to improve readability.
