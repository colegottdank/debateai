Your task is to analyze the following debate transcript on the topic \"${topic}\" and declare a winner.\n\n**Debate Transcript:**\n${debateTranscript}\n\n**Your Task:**\n1.  **Analyze the Debate:** Read the entire transcript and evaluate both the Human and the AI Opponent based on the criteria below.\n2.  **Scoring:** Provide a score from 1-10 for each of the three categories for both participants:\n    *   **Logic:** How well-reasoned were their arguments? Did they use fallacies?\n    *   **Evidence:** How well did they use facts, examples, and data to support their claims? (Note: The AI Opponent may have access to web search and use citations like [1], [2]).\n    *   **Persuasion:** How compelling and impactful were their arguments? Did they use strong rhetoric?\n3.  **Declare a Winner:** Based on the total scores, declare a winner. If the scores are tied, you must break the tie and make a choice.\n4.  **Write a Brief Verdict:** In one or two sentences, explain *why* you chose the winner. Be specific and reference a key moment or argument in the debate.\n\n**Response Format:**\nYour response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any text or explanation outside of the JSON structure.\n\n**JSON Structure:**\n\`\`\`json\n{\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"logic\": <score_1_to_10>,\n      \"evidence\": <score_1_to_10>,\n      \"persuasion\": <score_1_to_10>\n    },\n    \"ai\": {\n      \"logic\": <score_1_to_10>,\n      \"evidence\": <score_1_to_10>,\n      \"persuasion\": <score_1_to_10>\n    }\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"user\" | \"ai\" | \"tie\",\n  \"verdict\": \"<Your one or two-sentence explanation for the decision.>\"\n}\n\`\`\`\n\n**Example Response:**\n\`\`\`json\n{\n  \"scores\": {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"logic\": 7,\n      \"evidence\": 6,\n      \"persuasion\": 8\n    },\n    \"ai\": {\n      \"logic\": 8,\n      \"evidence\": 7,\n      \"persuasion\": 6\n    }\n  },\n  \"winner\": \"user\",\n  \"verdict\": \"While the AI had stronger evidence, the Human's persuasive appeal and logical consistency ultimately won the day, particularly with their closing argument.\"\n}\n\`\`\`\n\nNow, analyze the provided debate and return ONLY the JSON object with your judgment.`\n}\n
