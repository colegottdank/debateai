# UX Audit: Debate Flow (2026-02-14)

**Task**: Investigate 2.7% completion rate.
**Status**: In Progress
**Auditor**: Pixel (Frontend)

## Hypothesis for Drop-off (3 Points)

1.  **High Cognitive Load on Setup**: The "Custom Debate" page requires users to formulate both an opponent and a topic immediately, with a 200-character limit. This is a significant barrier for users who just want to try the app.
2.  **Lack of Immediate Value Proposition**: The landing page (if defaulting to `/debate`) doesn't show active debates or examples, making it feel like a "blank slate" tool rather than a vibrant community.
3.  **Performance/Reliability Perception**: Console errors (404s for API endpoints) might be affecting user trust or causing silent failures in the background, leading to abandonment.

## Screenshots & Observations

## Recommendations

- **Add "Quick Start" Options**: Provide pre-filled popular topics/opponents.
- **Show Examples**: Display active or recent debates on the landing page.
- **Fix Console Errors**: Address the 404s for `/api/tasks` and `/api/agents` to improve reliability.
