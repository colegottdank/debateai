# Debates Are Better With an Audience: Introducing Arena Mode

Let’s be honest: debating an AI can feel like talking to a wall. A very smart, very polite wall, but a wall nonetheless.

We looked at our data and saw a brutal stat: only **2.9%** of started debates actually reached a conclusion. Why?

Because friction is high and reward is low. You type a brilliant argument, the AI responds with a perfectly balanced paragraph, and… nothing happens. No one cheers. No one boos. No one awards points.

**Enter Arena Mode.**

We’re turning debate into the sport it deserves to be.

## What is it?

Arena Mode gamifies the DebateAI experience. Instead of an endless chat, you enter a match.

- **Scored Rounds:** Every argument is evaluated for logic, evidence, and persuasion.
- **Leaderboards:** Climb the ranks from Novice to Grandmaster.
- **Spectators:** Watch other debates unfold and vote on the winner.

## Why now?

We believe AI isn't just for answering questions—it's for sharpening your mind. But to do that, you need stakes. You need to know if you *actually* won.

Arena Mode is currently in private beta. We’re rolling it out to waitlist members starting next week.
